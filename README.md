This project involves the development of a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) User Interface, designed to manage users, roles, and permissions within a system. The application enables administrators to efficiently oversee user access, assign roles, and manage permissions in a secure and intuitive manner. The core objective was to design a highly functional UI that not only simplifies access control but also ensures scalability and flexibility in managing dynamic user roles and permissions.

Key Skills used to make this project:-
1. Node JS for javascript runtime environment.
2. Express JS for managing Routes.
3. EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for frontend.
4. MongoDB for Database.
5. POSTMAN for testing of routes.

Key Features:

User Management:
View and Manage Users: The application allows administrators to view a list of all users, with options to filter, search, and sort by various attributes.
CRUD Operations: Users can be added, edited, or deleted directly through the interface, ensuring seamless management of user accounts.
Role Assignment: The system allows users to be assigned specific roles

Role Management:
Create, Edit, and Delete Roles: Administrators can define custom roles with specific permissions tailored to different user needs.
Role Customization: Each role can be associated with predefined or custom permissions (such as Read, Write, Delete, etc.), enabling flexible access control based on the roleâ€™s needs.

Things which can be done in this project:-
We can change status of user (Active/Inactive) as needed. Or we can make users inactive if he attempts to login with wrong password many time.
